    <p>
      The Wendy’s Frosty is a cross between a milkshake and a soft-serve ice
      cream. This consistency is key and yet the hardest to mimic at home
      without a machine to keep it very very cold–our version is thinner, but it
      has the same satisfying fluffiness, mild chocolate flavor, and you can
      still enjoy it with a spoon. Plan ahead a little: Freeze the milk to get
      that thick creaminess—once frozen, the frosty comes together in just 5
      minutes!
