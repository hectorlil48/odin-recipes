    <h2>Garlic Parm Chicken</h2>

    <p>
      When you think Parm + chicken, you may be thinking of the melty, saucy
      chicken parm. If youâ€™re craving the classic combo but not in the mood to
      fry, then this garlic-Parmesan chicken (made in the slow cooker!) is the
      chicken dinner for you. Bone-in skin-on chicken thighs ensure a
      flavor-packed and tender result. Paired with a few pats of butter, garlic,
      and thyme, all the flavors seep into the chicken and tender baby potatoes
      for a fully satisfying, comforting meal, that requires very little effort.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 lb. bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 lb. baby red potatoes, quartered</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. butter, softened</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. fresh thyme</li>
      <li>Freshly chopped parsley</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add
        chicken, season with salt and pepper, and sear until golden, 3 minutes
        per side.

        Meanwhile, in a large slow cooker, toss potatoes with remaining 2
        tablespoons oil, butter, garlic, thyme, parsley, and Parmesan and season
        generously with salt and pepper. Add chicken and cook on high for 4
        hours or low for 8 hours, until potatoes are tender and chicken is fully
